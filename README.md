Your tour bus in space
Mars - Better than Uranus!

Automated Tourism allows you to designate rockets to act like regularly scheduled tour operators for Mars.
A tourist rocket will leave Mars on a regular schedule to pickup tourists on Earth and bring them to Mars.
It will also pickup tourists on Mars ready to leave and return home.
All automatically.
You built a nice planet, trees and all, send some ugly tourists.
